# Iris Flower Classification

This project uses a machine learning pipeline to classify iris flowers into three species â€” *setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica* â€” based on their sepal and petal measurements. It is based on the classic **Iris dataset** introduced by Ronald A. Fisher.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)
- **Attributes**:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)
  - Species (target variable with 3 classes)

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Model training using Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, etc.
- Evaluation with accuracy scores and confusion matrices

## ðŸ“ˆ Workflow

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Load Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** â€“ Use `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to analyze feature distributions and class separability.
3. **Modeling** â€“ Train and compare multiple models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Measure performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
